The AUG utilizes the same attachment points and even has the same ballistics as the SCAR-L, albeit with a higher muzzle velocity and slightly increased drag coefficient meaning that bullets fired from this gun will have a slightly more curved trajectory, canceled out by the fact that the bullets travel much faster compared to the SCAR-L.",

Its base damage per shot is slightly lower than the other 7.62mm assault rifles, offset by its rate of fire being almost as fast as that of the Groza, allowing its overall damage per second to be significantly higher than the comparable AKM. This comes at the cost of significantly higher recoil that — unlike the AKM — can be reduced by attaching foregrips.",

Replacing the US military's M14 as its standard service rifle, the first M16s were introduced in 1964 during the Vietnam War where they quickly grew an infamous reputation for reliablity problems, amongst other issues. Feedback from battlefield experience was then used to refine and improve the gun over the years and as a result, many derivatives and variants of the M16 have been created, with the fourth generation M16A4 being the latest development. Widely adopted by militaries around the world, in BATTLEGROUNDS it proves to be an assault rifle more suited for longer range engagements.",

As of 2015, the SCAR family of rifles is in service in over 20 countries. In BATTLEGROUNDS, it proves to be a well rounded rifle with a quieter muzzle report and good stability.",

It has a rather lengthy reload time so make sure the area is secure before inserting a fresh magazine.",

The most notable difference from the SKS is the ability of the Mk14 to switch to an automatic fire mode, enabling its wielder to deliver a huge amount of damage for different situations, whether it be house-clearing or surprise contact with another player. The high recoil limits the effectiveness of this function to close ranges however, and the already low magazine capacity coupled with the lengthy reload duration requires the user to have a very steady aim when going full auto, particularly if there is more than one enemy around.",

Thus, this rifle excels in medium-range combat and packs devastating stopping power if a user can handle this gun effectively in CQC (close-quarter combat), but will be less effective in long- to extreme-combat as it lacks the precision of dedicated sniper rifles. Players who wish to use a weapon with high damage, rate of fire and long range effectiveness should look for the SKS, as it is one of the few weapons with such properties.This gun also has the benefit of accepting the most attachments out of all the sniper rifles.",

Unlike the SKS however, it lacks an attachment point for any foregrips, requiring the user to have good recoil control and steady hands. Given that its initial bullet velocity is higher than that of the SKS as well as the fact that it also reloads slower, the SLR is more suited to ranged combat where there is ample cover and time to engage enemies. The length of the weapon may become an issue in close range engagements or when attempting to peek in and out of cover constantly.",

Because of the use of subsonic ammo, the weapon has a very low muzzle velocity at 330 m/s, compared to the Mini-14 at 990 m/s, making long distance shots and shots against moving targets difficult.",

      "Description": "The Kar98k is highly sought after because of its ability to deal fatal damage against players wearing level 2 helmets, with only level 3 helmets able to protect their wearers from one shot kills assuming they are at more than 85% health. Because of this, it is a very good weapon for long-range engagements without having the risk of going to airdrops for the other bolt-action sniper rifles. Its main drawbacks are its slow reload time when reloading, with full reloads only being somewhat faster than reloading bullets individually, and its rather slow bullet velocity, making it more challenging to engage distant enemies, particularly if they are on the move.",

When fitted with a choke, the S686 can perform surprisingly well at distances up to 15m. The low ammo capacity leaves no room for error however, as a missed shot can mean a quick death.",

When fully modded with extended mags, a stock and a compensator, this gun becomes quite controllable and can be surprisingly viable in the final stages of the game, although the extremely high rate of fire will burn through ammo quickly if many shots miss.",

At 300 meters, the width of a standing person will be obscured by the center dot. Keeping this in mind, aim can then be adjusted for whichever range the target is at to deal precision shots and as most engagements typically take place within 300 meters, the usefulness of this scope is often underestimated. The brightness of the reticle can also be adjusted to current lighting conditions.",

As such, the Mini-14 works well since it has the fastest initial bullet speed of any gun in the game, surpassing even the powerful AWM, although the superior ballistics of the AWM's .300 Magnum ammo mean that it has less drag than the Mini-14. Due to its very strong zoom, scope sway is also drastically exaggerated, requiring the user to hold their breath before every shot if engaging targets at extreme distances. The strong zoom also necessitates keeping a spare lower power sight in the inventory for closer range encounters.",
